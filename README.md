🌪️ Visualizing U.S. Natural Disaster Declarations 🇺🇸
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing U.S. natural disaster declaration data to uncover patterns, trends, and regional impacts of disasters over time. Using interactive and static visualizations, the project helps transform complex FEMA data into meaningful insights 📈🗺️.

The analysis highlights:
📅 How disaster declarations change over time
🏛️ Which states are most affected
🌊 Which disaster types occur most frequently
📍 How disaster patterns vary by geography and incident type

❓ Problem Statement

The United States experiences a wide variety of natural disasters every year 🌪️🔥🌊. However, raw FEMA disaster data is large, complex, and difficult to interpret without proper analysis and visualization.

🎯 Objective
To analyze and visualize FEMA’s Disaster Declarations dataset in order to understand:
Trends in disaster declarations over the years
State-wise and regional disaster impact
Frequency of different disaster types
Geographic variation in disaster patterns

📂 Dataset Summary

Source: FEMA Disaster Declarations Dataset
Coverage: United States

📊 The dataset enables long-term trend analysis and regional comparison of disaster occurrences.

📊 KPI Usages

The following key performance indicators (KPIs) are used in the analysis:
🔢 Total number of disaster declarations
🗺️ Number of disasters by state
📅 Year-wise disaster trends
🌪️ Most common disaster types
📍 Regional distribution of disasters

🖥️ Dashboard Pages

The visual analysis is organized into multiple views:

📅 Time-Based Analysis
Disaster declarations by year
Trend analysis over decades

🗺️ State & Regional Analysis
Most affected states
Region-wise disaster comparison

🌊 Disaster Type Analysis
Frequency of disaster types (Flood, Hurricane, Fire, etc.)
Comparison of incident types across regions

🔍 Key Insights

📈 Disaster declarations have increased over time, especially after the 2000s
🏛️ Certain states experience disasters far more frequently than others
🌊 Floods, hurricanes, and severe storms are among the most common disaster types
📍 Coastal and southern regions show higher disaster concentration

✅ Recommendations

🛡️ States with high disaster frequency should strengthen disaster preparedness and response planning
📊 Historical trends should be used to improve risk assessment and resource allocation
🌍 Region-specific disaster mitigation strategies can reduce long-term impacts
🔄 Continuous monitoring of disaster data can help policymakers make data-driven decisions

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

🐍 Python – Core programming language
